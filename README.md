📜 Commander’s Statement

> "We would rather live in a world without technology than in a world ruled by machines."
— Commander Hulagu



Artificial intelligence is a neutral tool. But in the wrong hands — or if it evolves beyond control — it becomes a threat greater than any weapon mankind has ever known.

This protocol is our final defense.
